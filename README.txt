This package provides the M. genitalium whole-cell knowledge base and simulation. 
The script install.php installs the knowledge base and simulation, including 
configuring the whole-cell model code for a Rocks Linux cluster. See install.php
for installation instructions.


Obtaining the knowledge, model, and simulation results
=================================================================================
All of the code, training data, and results of the whole-cell study are freely
available at simtk.org/home/wholecell. All of the code, training data, and results
are released under the MIT license. See license.txt for further information.
