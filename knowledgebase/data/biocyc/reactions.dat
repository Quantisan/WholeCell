COMMENT - MunI type II restriction/modification methylation reaction. MunI recognizes the sequence 5'-CAATTG-3' [PUB_0096]. MunI methylase methylates the N6 position of A-3 of hemimethylated DNA producing N6-methyladenine, and MunI endonuclease cleaves the C-A phosphodiester bond of unmethylated DNA in an ATP-independent manner [PUB_0006]. In constrant to type I restriction/modification systems, the methylase and endonuclease are two independent proteins. M. genitalium only contains the methylase of the MunI restriction/modification system.
/
/Methylation occurs by transfer from S-Adenosyl-L-methionine [PUB_0458].
/
/Jeltsch and colleagues have observed the methylation of type II restriction systems as a function of several parameters: 0.000059 - 0.079 1/h [PUB_0548], 0.34-3.9 [PUB_0549], 0.55-13 1/h [PUB_0550], 0.11-3.8 1/h [PUB_0551]. The rate limiting step is methyl group transfer. Under saturating S-Adenosyl-L-methionine conditions the kinetic rate rises to 3.9 1/h [PUB_0549], 3.8 1/h [PUB_0551].

COMMENT - RuvAB catalyzes strand migration by an ATP-dependent mechanism [PUB_0532]. RuvA tetramers unfold the junction in a square planar conformation [PUB_0532]. RuvB hexamers possess DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is stimulated by RuvA [PUB_0536]. Although there is 1 ATP binding site per RuvB monomer, each hexamer only binds 2 ATPs, only 1 of which is hydrolyzed [PUB_0537]. Junction migration occurs in discrete hops of mean length 2.2 bases [PUB_0538] at a rate 3-100 bp/s [PUB_0531, PUB_0532, PUB_0533, PUB_0534, PUB_0535, PUB_0538]. Junctions are preferentially resolved at the sequence 5'-(A/T)TT?(G/C)-3' [PUB_0532].

It is not yet clear how RecA protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis is coupled to strand exchange [PUB_0529]. Kinetic rate determined by Bazemore et al (0.05-0.07 1/s) [PUB_0528], Xiao et al (0.053-0.42) [PUB_0529], and Bhattacharyya et al (0.082 1/min) [PUB_0530].

COMMENT - Oligonucleotide excision is powered by ATP hydrolysis [PUB_0531]. Several groups have studied PcrA energetics and kinetics. Wigley report that 1-23 bases are excised per ATP [PUB_0541]; Tomko et al report that PcrA catalyzes excision at the rate 193 nt/s and 1 ATP/nt [PUB_0516]. PcrA is active as a dimer [PUB_0541].

COMMENT - UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC form complexes that recognize DNA damage, and incise DNA 3' and 5' to damaged lesions in nucleotide excision repair. UvrA-C function according to the scheme below [PUB_0461]:
/
/UvrA2B complex recognizes DNA damage
/UvrA hydrolyzes ATP and dissociates from UvrB, leaving a DNA-UvrB complex
/UvrC complexes with UvrB, inducing a conformational change in UvrB which nicks the DNA 4 nt 3' to the damage
/UvrC nicks the DNA 7 nt 5' to the damage
/
/
/Kinetics
/Sancar and others report kinetic rates in the range kcat=0.08-0.50 1/min [PUB_0767].
/
/Incision catalyzed by UvrABC at rate 0.39 fmol/min by 20 ?mol solution containing 10 nM UvrA, 1000 nM UvrB, and 5 nM UvcR [PUB_0515].
