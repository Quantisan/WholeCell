   Introduction
   ======================
   Medical relevance
   ++++++++++++++++++++++
   14 Mycoplasmas and 2 ureaplasmas have been detected in humans
   [PUB_0840]. 6 of these species, including M. genitalium have been found
   in the urogenital tract. M. genitalium is a common urogenital pathogen,
   and one of the most common causes of non-gnoccocal urethritis. M.
   genitalium is estimated to colonize the urogenital tract of 3% of all
   women [PUB_0840], and up to 9-10% in some populations [PUB_0841]. Most
   M. genitalium infections are asymptomatic, and many researchers have
   written that M. genitalium is close to &quot;ideal parasite&quot; [PUB_0313],
   typically living in  harmony with its host. A small fraction of M.
   genitalium infections manifest as urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic
   inflammatory disease.

   Pathophysiology
   ++++++++++++++++++++++
   Little is known about the pathophysiology of M. genitalium. The
   literature on M. genitalium pathophysiology has focused on a few
   topics:
   1. Adhesion
      Several studies have suggested that the terminal organelle
      lipoproteins MG_191, MG_192, MG_217, MG_318, and MG_386 are involved
      in adhesion [PUB_0088, PUB_0313]
   2. Host immune response activation
      Several studies have suggested that the gene products of MG_149,
      MG_309, and MG_412 activate the host NF-kB response through
      interaction with host TLR receptors 1, 2, and 6 [PUB_0194, PUB_0842,
      PUB_0844].
   3. Antigenicity and antigenic variation
      Several studies have focused on antigenticity and antigenic
      variation. Razin reported that MgPa (MG_191) is one of the main
      antigenic components, and that antibodies against it may be found in
      infected patients [PUB_0088]. Shimizu et al have observed two
      differentially expressed forms of MG_149 -- P18 and P20 [PUB_0844].
   4. Toxic byproducts
      M. genitalium byproducts including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide
      radicals have been suggested to cause oxidative damage to host
      membranes [PUB_0313].

   The following table summarizes genes that have been implicated
   interactions with mammalian hosts.

     MG_309                           lipoprotein          activates NF-kB as TLR 2/6 ligand
     MG_312  HMW1, P65                Trm Org core         motility, attachment
     MG_317  HMW3, P200, P69          Trm Org core         motility, attachment
     MG_318  P30, P32                 Trm Org lipoprotein  adhesion
     MG_386  P200                     Trm Org lipoprotein  adhesion
     MG_412  N-ALP1                   lipoprotein          activates NF-kB as TLR 1/2 ligand

   Diagnosis
   ++++++++++++++++++++++
   M. genitalium is typically not directly diagnosed, but rather is
   diagnosed by negative results for other urogenital pathogen. Nucleic
   acid amplification testing (NAAT) is commonly used to rule out
   chlamydia infection, and suggest M. genitalium infection. Less commonly
   NAAT is used directly to diagnose M. genitalium infection.

   Treatment
   ++++++++++++++++++++++
   M. genitalium is most commonly treated using macrolides such as
   azithromycin and tetracycline [PUB_0840]. Azithromycin-resistant M.
   genitalium may be treated with fluoroquinolones [PUB_0840].
   Taylor-Robinson and Bebear have catalogued the susceptibility of M.
   genitalium to 18 antibiotics [PUB_0846].

   Tetracycline and aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit the 30S ribosomal
   particle. Macrolides and lincosamide antibiotics inhibit the 50S
   ribosomal particle. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics inhibit topoisomerase
   II/DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.

   Knowledge Base
   ======================
   The antibiotic susceptibilities of M. genitalium proteins are encoded
   as protein activation rules in the knowledge base, and are simulated by
   the ProteinActivation class. 32 antibiotics are represented as
   metabolites in the knowledge base.

   Representation
   ======================
   The state of the M. genitalium proteins involved in interaction with
   the mammalian urogenital epithelium is represented by the enzymes
   property. This property contains the current copy number of each
   protein.

   The state of the host mammalian urogenital epithelium is represented by
   4 boolean properties in the host class:
   - isBacteriumAdherent: indicates whether or not cell is adherent to the epithelial surface
   - isTLRActivated: indicates the state of host TLRs 1, 2, and 6
   - isNFkBActivated: indicates the state of host NF-kB
   - isInflammatoryResponseActivated: indicates the state of the host inflammatory response

   Initialization
   ======================
   The state of the M. genitalium host interaction proteins is initialized
   by the initializeState method of the Simulation class. All proteins are
   initialized to the mature state and localization.

   The state of the host urogenital epithelium is initialized using the
   same Boolean rules as in the evolveState method. That is we assume that
   the urogenital epithelium is in a steady-state with respect to its
   interaction with M. genitalium.

   Simulation
   ======================
   Very little quantitative is available for the interaction between M.
   genitalium and its mammalian host. The little data available is
   patchwork and qualitative. Thus the model here for the interaction of
   M. genitalium with its host is necessarily qualitative.

   The model consists of several Boolean rules which calculate the value
   of the 4 properties of the Host class:
   1. M. genitalium is adherent if the terminal organelle is properly
      formed and all the adhesion proteins are expressed.
   2. TLRs 1, 2, and 6 are activated if M. genitalium is adherent (see
      rule 1) and the M. genitalium lipoprotein ligands are expressed.
   3. NF-kB is activated if TLRs 1 and 2 or TLRs 2 and 6 are activated.
   4. The host inflammatory response is activated if NF-kB is activated or
      if MG_075 is present.

   The model assumes that the mammalian urogenital epithelium reaches a
   steady-state quickly with respect to its interaction with M.
   genitalium.
