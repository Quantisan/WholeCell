%   Introduction
%   ======================
%   Medical relevance
%   ++++++++++++++++++++++
%   14 Mycoplasmas and 2 ureaplasmas have been detected in humans
%   [PUB_0840]. 6 of these species, including M. genitalium have been found
%   in the urogenital tract. M. genitalium is a common urogenital pathogen,
%   and one of the most common causes of non-gnoccocal urethritis. M.
%   genitalium is estimated to colonize the urogenital tract of 3% of all
%   women [PUB_0840], and up to 9-10% in some populations [PUB_0841]. Most
%   M. genitalium infections are asymptomatic, and many researchers have
%   written that M. genitalium is close to "ideal parasite" [PUB_0313],
%   typically living in  harmony with its host. A small fraction of M.
%   genitalium infections manifest as urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic
%   inflammatory disease.
%
%   Pathophysiology
%   ++++++++++++++++++++++
%   Little is known about the pathophysiology of M. genitalium. The
%   literature on M. genitalium pathophysiology has focused on a few
%   topics:
%   1. Adhesion
%      Several studies have suggested that the terminal organelle
%      lipoproteins MG_191, MG_192, MG_217, MG_318, and MG_386 are involved
%      in adhesion [PUB_0088, PUB_0313]
%   2. Host immune response activation
%      Several studies have suggested that the gene products of MG_149,
%      MG_309, and MG_412 activate the host NF-kB response through
%      interaction with host TLR receptors 1, 2, and 6 [PUB_0194, PUB_0842,
%      PUB_0844].
%   3. Antigenicity and antigenic variation
%      Several studies have focused on antigenticity and antigenic
%      variation. Razin reported that MgPa (MG_191) is one of the main
%      antigenic components, and that antibodies against it may be found in
%      infected patients [PUB_0088]. Shimizu et al have observed two
%      differentially expressed forms of MG_149 -- P18 and P20 [PUB_0844].
%   4. Toxic byproducts
%      M. genitalium byproducts including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide
%      radicals have been suggested to cause oxidative damage to host
%      membranes [PUB_0313].
%
%   The following table summarizes genes that have been implicated
%   interactions with mammalian hosts.

%
%   Diagnosis
%   ++++++++++++++++++++++
%   M. genitalium is typically not directly diagnosed, but rather is
%   diagnosed by negative results for other urogenital pathogen. Nucleic
%   acid amplification testing (NAAT) is commonly used to rule out
%   chlamydia infection, and suggest M. genitalium infection. Less commonly
%   NAAT is used directly to diagnose M. genitalium infection.
%
%   Treatment
%   ++++++++++++++++++++++
%   M. genitalium is most commonly treated using macrolides such as
%   azithromycin and tetracycline [PUB_0840]. Azithromycin-resistant M.
%   genitalium may be treated with fluoroquinolones [PUB_0840].
%   Taylor-Robinson and Bebear have catalogued the susceptibility of M.
%   genitalium to 18 antibiotics [PUB_0846].
%
%   Tetracycline and aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit the 30S ribosomal
%   particle. Macrolides and lincosamide antibiotics inhibit the 50S
%   ribosomal particle. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics inhibit topoisomerase
%   II/DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
%
%   Knowledge Base
%   ======================
%   The antibiotic susceptibilities of M. genitalium proteins are encoded
%   as protein activation rules in the knowledge base, and are simulated by
%   the ProteinActivation class. 32 antibiotics are represented as
%   metabolites in the knowledge base.
%
%   Representation
%   ======================
%   The state of the M. genitalium proteins involved in interaction with
%   the mammalian urogenital epithelium is represented by the enzymes
%   property. This property contains the current copy number of each
%   protein.
%
%   The state of the host mammalian urogenital epithelium is represented by
%   4 boolean properties in the host class:
%   - isBacteriumAdherent: indicates whether or not cell is adherent to the epithelial surface
%   - isTLRActivated: indicates the state of host TLRs 1, 2, and 6
%   - isNFkBActivated: indicates the state of host NF-kB
%   - isInflammatoryResponseActivated: indicates the state of the host inflammatory response
%
%   Initialization
%   ======================
%   The state of the M. genitalium host interaction proteins is initialized
%   by the initializeState method of the Simulation class. All proteins are
%   initialized to the mature state and localization.
%
%   The state of the host urogenital epithelium is initialized using the
%   same Boolean rules as in the evolveState method. That is we assume that
%   the urogenital epithelium is in a steady-state with respect to its
%   interaction with M. genitalium.
%
%   Simulation
%   ======================
%   Very little quantitative is available for the interaction between M.
%   genitalium and its mammalian host. The little data available is
%   patchwork and qualitative. Thus the model here for the interaction of
%   M. genitalium with its host is necessarily qualitative.
%
%   The model consists of several Boolean rules which calculate the value
%   of the 4 properties of the Host class:
%   1. M. genitalium is adherent if the terminal organelle is properly
%      formed and all the adhesion proteins are expressed.
%   2. TLRs 1, 2, and 6 are activated if M. genitalium is adherent (see
%      rule 1) and the M. genitalium lipoprotein ligands are expressed.
%   3. NF-kB is activated if TLRs 1 and 2 or TLRs 2 and 6 are activated.
%   4. The host inflammatory response is activated if NF-kB is activated or
%      if MG_075 is present.
%
%   The model assumes that the mammalian urogenital epithelium reaches a
%   steady-state quickly with respect to its interaction with M.
%   genitalium.
