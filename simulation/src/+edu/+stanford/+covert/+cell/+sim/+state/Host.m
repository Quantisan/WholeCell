%   This class reports qualitative metrics regarding the ability of M.
%   genitalium to interact with host human urogenital tract epithelial
%   cells:
%   - ability of M. genitalium to adhere to the urogenital epithelium,
%     which requires adhesins and a functional terminal organelle
%   - ability of M. genitalium lipoproteins to interact with host TLR
%     receptors 1, 2, and 6
